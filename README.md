# melon-3
A theme for [Trilium Notes](https://github.com/zadam/trilium), "_a hierarchical note taking application with focus on building large personal knowledge bases_". I really like this application and its many features. At the same time I felt like it needed some visual _overhaul_ for lack of better terms. I am trying to achieve a consistent look and feel.

Sometimes things break (e.g. due to updates of the application) - please don't hesitate to file an issue!

## Theme Installation
Install the theme by following these steps:
- copy the (**raw**) content of _trilium-theme-melon-3.css_
- paste it into a new trilium note named "melon-theme-3"
- add a new attribute to the melon-theme note (Alt + A)
  - Type: Label
  - Name: appTheme
  - Value: _empty_
  - inheritable: _not ticked_
- go to Menu > Options
- select it as your new theme

Further instructions and information on themes can be found [here](https://github.com/zadam/trilium/wiki/Themes)

## Additional Fonts
To get the full experience you need to install some additional fonts.
- The web font files (.woff) have to be imported into the theme note (right click on theme note, select _Import into note_)
- the _customResourceProvider_ attribute needs to be added to every font file you want to use
- the respective attribute _value_ should be _fonts/Font-File-Name.woff_
